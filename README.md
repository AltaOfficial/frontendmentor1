## My process

First I created a github repo for this project, pushed all of the initial starter files, then I looked up a youtube video on how to go about completing this, after I was finished watching that, I noticed it wasn't 1:1 to the design photo (the subtext was only two lines when it shouldve been three) so I looked at some of solutions others made and I learned that I could used some padding and font size changes to make the subtext 3 lines.

### Built with

- non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more of how to use rem instead of px, most of the project was just refreshing my memory on css.

### Continued development

Id like to focus more on using flexbox, css grids, and rem.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM&t=360s) - Helped me with how I should go about the this challenge.
- [Resource 2](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/landing-page-using-tailwindcss-oEe2kclA63) - Looked to this to see how they made the description 3 lines instead of just 2.
